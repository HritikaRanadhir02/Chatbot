# Pizza Ordering Chatbot

A simple, interactive chatbot built using Python to simulate the process of ordering pizza. This chatbot guides users through selecting pizza size, crust, and toppings, and confirms the order in a conversational format.

##Features
1. Interactive conversational flow using Python
2. Collects user input for:
  Pizza size (Small, Medium, Large)
  Crust type (Thin, Thick, Cheese Burst)
  Toppings (e.g., Onion, Capsicum, Jalapeno, etc.)
3. Validates input and handles incorrect options
4. Displays a summary of the pizza order

##Project Structure
Chatbot.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the chatbot code and execution flow

##Technologies Used
Python (Core language for logic)
Jupyter Notebook (for development and demonstration)

##How It Works
1. The chatbot greets the user.

2. It asks for the pizza size and validates the input.

3. It proceeds to ask for the crust type, again validating input.

4. The user can select multiple toppings.

5. Finally, the chatbot confirms and displays the final order.

##Sample Interaction
